# Computer Architecture

## **Storage Components**

### **Disk (Primary Storage)**

- **Purpose**: Stores all data persistently, retaining information even after the computer is powered off.
- **Storage Capacity**:
    - Gigabytes (GB)
    - Terabytes (TB)
- **Data Unit**: 1 bit = 4 bytes (used to store information).
- **Types**:
    - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**:
        - Mechanical parts with a read/write head.
        - Slower over time due to mechanical wear.
    - **SSD (Solid State Drive)**:
        - No moving parts.
        - Faster and more reliable compared to HDDs.

### **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

- **Purpose**: Temporarily stores information while the computer is running.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Keeps applications and data active for quick access.
    - Faster than Disk for read/write operations.
    - More expensive than Disk storage.
- **Storage Capacity**:
    - Megabytes (MB)
    - Gigabytes (GB)

### **Cache**

- **Purpose**: Speeds up data access by storing frequently used data closer to the CPU.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Smaller and faster than RAM and Disk.
    - Optimized for rapid read/write operations.
- **Storage Capacity**:
    - Megabytes (MB)

## **Processing Unit**

### **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

- **Purpose**: Executes code and performs computations.
- **Functions**:
    - Reads and writes information from RAM and Disk.
    - Processes instructions by converting code into machine language (0’s and 1’s).
    - Executes tasks based on the instructions provided.

## **Data**

- **Purpose**: Stored in variable formats in either RAM or Disk, depending on usage and access requirements.

### **Key Comparisons**

| Component | Speed | Size | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Disk** | Slow | Large (GB/TB) | Persistent storage of all data. |
| **RAM** | Faster than Disk | Medium (GB/MB) | Temporary storage for running applications and active processes. |
| **Cache** | Fastest | Small (MB) | Temporary storage for frequently accessed data to speed up CPU tasks. |
